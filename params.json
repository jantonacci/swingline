I like BASH and Python and meat (that's what I'm made of!). I have\r\nhad breakfast burritos for lunch and find them superior to lunch burritos.\r\n\r\nSwingline helps you spend less time on log search and more time on log review.\r\nStorage performance issues require reviewing multiple ESXi host's log bundles,\r\ncorrelating events, and educating both customer and vendors. We need an\r\nautomated method to accelerate review, generate results suitable for\r\ncollaboration, and do quick statistical analysis.
